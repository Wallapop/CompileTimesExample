# Talk: `Compile Times: Breath of the Swift`

Gave gy [Luis Ascorbe](https://twitter.com/lascorbe) at [NSBarcelona](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/nsbarcelona/) on March 14th, 2016.

This project's intention is to hold the slides of the talk, and also to provide an example project showing how the script shown on the talk works.

# Thanks

The script and some of the code shown on the talk is based on the work of [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell), specifically his blog post about [Improving Swift compile times](https://medium.com/@johnsundell/improving-swift-compile-times-ee1d52fb9bd#.bsv07umje).

I would like to also say thanks to my team for all their help on the process of migrating to Swift 3.0 and improving our compilation times :heart:
